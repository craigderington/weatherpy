## weatherpy

##### A simple Flask web app that allows the user to interact with the Weather Underground data APIs.  This project is not affiliated in any way with the Weather Underground.  Have fun learning Python through Public Data Hacking.

* AutoComplete API: allows the user to look up a geographic location by name and return it's corresponding name, country, timezone, latitude and longitude.


Once the user has selected a "location", weatherpy calls the following APIs to display information to the user.

* Geolookup
* Conditions
* Webcams
* Satellite
* Forecast
* Forecast 10 Day
* Alerts
* Astronomy
* Tides
* History
